//üìå Task
//Visualize your favorite sorting algorithm, custom UI, swiftUI and animations are welcome in any combination.
//
//
//üìñ Details
//The app should have a UI that allows the user to input an array of integers and a button that starts visualization which reflects sorting of the user input. Also the app should have two buttons: step back and forward which visualize transition to the next and previous step in the algorithm.
//
//
//üí° Tech requirements
//App should be an iOS application that runs on a modern device (iPhone 13 /14) and latest OS
//(iOS 16). Compatibility with older devices/OS is not required.
//
//You are free to choose Objective-C or Swift, any patterns and approaches. Implementation is
//not limited at any level, i.e. to build the UI you can choose anything from OpenGL to SwiftUI.
//Code should compile on Xcode 14/MacOS 13 without errors. We expect you will provide a
//link to GitHub repo, more than one commit length history is a plus.
//
//You can't use any 3rd party dependencies. You have three hours.
//
//
//‚úèÔ∏èÔ∏è What is considered important
//Overall architecture of  the project, potential scalability, ease of changes and adding new features. Code style, errors and border conditions handling. If you didn't manage to finish what you planned ‚Äì please specify what still needs to be done.
//
//We hope you like programming as much as we do and will enjoy the task.
//
//Have fun :)
